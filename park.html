									<h2>Project Overview</h2>
									<b>Methods Used: </b>Questionnaires, Literature Review, Interviews
									<br /><b>Tools Used: </b>TBD
									<br /><b>Group Members: </b>Bria Fowler, Eric Graham, Serena Mistry
									<br /><b>Project Duration: </b>Oct. 2017 - Present (In Progress)
									<br />
									<br />
									<h2>Our Task</h2>
									For our Interaction Design class at the School of Information, we were tasked with identifying an interaction design-focused project to prototype. Because we are interested in submitting a project for the next CHI conference, we chose to focus on a project that would fit within the CHI Student Design Competition guidelines of "engaging communities", which is a very broad topic.
									<br />
									<br />
									<h2>Our Solution</h2>
									We are focusing on developing an augmented reality smartphone app to bring people together in public parks to collaborate on interactive games and tasks. Through creativity and play, we hope to bring diverse groups together to give people a sense of community while reaping the benefits of outdoor activity.

									<i>Concept video created by Eric Graham</i>
									<br />
									While our concept video used the classic Pacman game since it was easy to incorporate, our actual app will include more collaborative games and activities that will allow people to create things together in order to create a sense of mutual goals and community.
									<br />
									<br />
									<h2>Our Process</h2>
									<b>Ideation</b>
									<br />
									To begin the ideation process, we wrote down words that came to us when thinking about "community". We then used them as a starting point for two rounds of Crazy 8's sketching to generate concepts. We placed the second round of sketches on the white board and voted on our favorite concepts. After voting, we had a consensus on creating an app for multi-player augmented reality games in public spaces.

									<br />
									We chose our app to be location-based in public parks for several reasons:
									<ul>
										<li>It brings people together in a concentrated area so they can form in-person connections as well as virtual connections.</li>
										<li>Being outside contributes to mental and physical health and parks create a feeling of community.</li>
										<li>Almost 70% of people in the country's 100 biggest cities live within a 10 minute walk of a park; we hope to increase utilization of these existing spaces.</li>
										<li>While previous AR apps like Pokemon Go were popular, our app will remove some of the problematic elements (crowds gathering outside of peoples' houses, players not paying attention while crossing streets, etc.</li>
									</ul>
									<br />
									<h2>Next Steps</h2>
									Over the next two months we will be designing a questionnaire and analyzing the results, performing interviews, creating a journey map, iterating on prototypes, and developing a basic working app.
